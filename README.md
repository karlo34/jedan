Description
This project consists of two main components: "Header" and "Cards". The "Cards" component utilizes the map function to iterate through an array of objects, displaying cards and their respective attributes. Clicking on a card displays the details of the selected product.

Challenges
I faced several challenges during this project:

Implementing or using Medusa server
Implementing or using Tailwind CSS (mainly due to a lack of time)
Achievements
Despite the challenges, I am particularly proud of:

Dynamically generated file routing for card detail pages. This was my first time encountering and working with this concept, and I found it enjoyable to learn.
Using the useState hook to change the display of HTML elements. This can be seen on the card details page, where a loading state is shown to fetch the number of the index from the URL.
