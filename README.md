The project consists of "header" and "cards" components. Cards component is based on map function that goes thrue array of objects that displays cards and their attributes. I didn't know how to make database so I used js file with const variable. When the card is clicked you get the details of, in this case, the product.

I have spend around a week on the project because I was out of town and than I got sick so I was unable to work.

Most challanging
- how to implement or use medusa server
- implementing or using tailwind (mostly cause of lacking in time)

Most proud of
-  dynamicly file routing (card detail page) because it was my first time using or even seeing something like that but it was fun learning it
-  using useState hook for chaning display of "HTML" that can be seen also on card details page (loading was there so file has time to fetch the number of index from url)
